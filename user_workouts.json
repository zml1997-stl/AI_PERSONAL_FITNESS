{"type": "Weightlifting", "duration": 45, "goal": "Build Muscle", "plan": "Okay, here's an intermediate weightlifting workout plan designed for a 45-minute session, focusing on building muscle (hypertrophy).  It's important to listen to your body and adjust the weight and reps as needed. Remember to prioritize good form over lifting heavy weight.\n\n**Important Considerations Before Starting:**\n\n*   **Warm-up is crucial:** Don't skip it!  It prepares your muscles and reduces the risk of injury.\n*   **Proper Form:** Watch videos and practice the correct form for each exercise. Start with lighter weights if needed.\n*   **Rest Periods:**  Keep rest periods between sets to 60-90 seconds. This is optimal for hypertrophy.\n*   **Nutrition:**  Muscle growth requires sufficient protein and calories.\n*   **Progression:** Gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week as you get stronger.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience pain, stop the exercise immediately.\n*   **Spotter (If Needed):** Use a spotter for heavier lifts, especially bench press and squats.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.\n\n**Workout Schedule:**\n\nThis is a full-body workout, hitting all major muscle groups. Perform this workout 2-3 times per week, with at least one day of rest in between.\n\n**Workout Breakdown (45 Minutes)**\n\n**I. Warm-up (5 minutes)**\n\n*   **Light Cardio (2 minutes):**\n    *   Jumping Jacks, High Knees, Butt Kicks, or Jogging in place\n*   **Dynamic Stretching (3 minutes):**\n    *   Arm Circles (forward and backward) - 10 reps each direction\n    *   Leg Swings (forward and backward) - 10 reps each leg\n    *   Torso Twists - 10 reps each side\n    *   Bodyweight Squats - 10 reps\n\n**II.

Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed out.  Squat down as if sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and chest up.\n*   **Bench Press:** Lie on a bench with your feet flat on the floor.

Adapt it to your own needs and fitness level. Good luck!\n"}
{"type": "Custom", "duration": 30, "goal": "Build Muscle", "plan": "Alright, let's build those legs and core for stronger running! We're going to maximize muscle growth within our 30-minute window with a focus on compound movements.\n\n**Workout Goal:** Muscle hypertrophy (building muscle) in legs and core.\n\n**Time:** 30 minutes\n\n**Workout Level:** Suitable for someone with a *basic understanding* of proper form. If you're completely new to lifting, please watch videos demonstrating proper form for each exercise before starting. Prioritize proper form over the number of reps.\n\n**Workout Structure:**\n\n*   **Warm-up (5 minutes)**\n*   **Main Workout (20 minutes)**\n*   **Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n\n**Detailed Workout:**\n\n**1. Warm-up (5 minutes)**\n\n*   **Dynamic Stretching:** This prepares the muscles for movement and reduces the risk of injury.\n    *   **Leg Swings (forward/backward & side-to-side):** 10 reps per leg, each direction. Focus on controlled movement.\n    *   **Bodyweight Squats:** 10 reps. Get a good feel for your squat depth.\n    *   **Walking Lunges:** 10 reps per leg.

Main Workout (20 minutes)**\n\n*   **Workout Structure:** Perform the following exercises as a circuit. Do each exercise back-to-back with minimal rest (15-20 seconds) between exercises. After completing all exercises, rest for 1-2 minutes. Repeat the entire circuit 2-3 more times, depending on your energy levels.\n\n    *   **Barbell Back Squats or Goblet Squats**: 8-12 reps. *Key Exercise for overall leg strength*. If using a barbell, ensure you can maintain good form and control. If unsure, use a dumbbell or kettlebell held in front of your chest (Goblet Squat). Choose a weight that is challenging but allows you to maintain proper form for all reps.\n    *   **Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)**: 8-12 reps. *Targets hamstrings and glutes.* Focus on hinging at the hips, keeping your back straight, and feeling the stretch in your hamstrings. If you don't have weights, practice the hip hinge movement to get a good feel for the form.\n    *   **Walking Lunges or Reverse Lunges:** 10-12 reps per leg. *Great for quad and glute development.* Focus on controlled descent and pushing through your front heel.  If you have dumbbells, use them (one in each hand).\n    *   **Plank:** Hold for 30-60 seconds. *Essential core strengthening.* Maintain a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core and glutes. If that's too challenging start at 20 sec and work your way up.\n    *   **Crunches:** 15-20 reps. *Targets upper abs*. Keep your lower back pressed against the floor and focus on using your abs to lift your shoulders.\n    *   **Leg Raises:** 15-20 reps. *Targets lower abs.* Lie on your back with your hands under your butt for support. Lift your legs towards the ceiling, keeping them straight. Lower them slowly, stopping just before they touch the ground.\n\n**3. Cool-down (5 minutes)**\n\n*   **Static Stretching:** Holding stretches for 20-30 seconds. Improves flexibility and reduces muscle soreness.\n    *   **Quadriceps Stretch:** Hold each leg.\n    *   **Hamstring Stretch:** Hold each leg.  Seated or standing.\n    *   **Glute Stretch (Figure Four Stretch):** Hold each leg.\n    *   **Calf Stretch:** Hold each leg.\n    *   **Torso Twist (seated or lying):** Hold each side.\n\n**Important Considerations and Tips:**\n\n*   **Proper Form is Paramount:** Watch videos of each exercise and ensure you understand the proper form. Record yourself if necessary to critique your technique.\n*   **Weight Selection:** Choose a weight that challenges you in the 8-12 rep range. You should be able to complete the reps with good form, but the last rep or two should be difficult.\n*   **Progressive Overload:** To continue building muscle, gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Rest when you need to. Don't push through pain.\n*   **Nutrition and Rest:** Muscle growth requires adequate protein intake and sufficient sleep. Aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n*   **Consistency is Key:** Aim to do this workout 2-3 times per week, with rest days in between.\n\n**Workout Modifications:**\n\n*   **Too Easy:** Increase the weight, increase reps, slow down the tempo of the exercise (focus on control), add an extra set.\n*   **Too Difficult:** Reduce the weight, reduce reps, shorten rest periods, remove an exercise from the circuit.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions! Good luck with your workout!\n"}
